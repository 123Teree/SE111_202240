    <p>Alvin Terrell/ Contractor carpenter, attending New England Tech to deversify company into Cybertechnology.
        Technology and Modern Homes are also a passion.
        I Love health, working out, work in planning my vision for leaving a positive footprint on earth that will last.
        I had a business in Liberia West Africa for 5 year's and I often travel the world. I think it's important to
        walk my path at all cost.
        My life is about more than me, I am like a Slow moving mountain with millions of parts. My past is my future in
        strong positive morals. About Me reference book
        Mama Netti's Time To Love. I have a strong computer backgroud i'm battling to surface after a few year's of
        trauma. Life is Great, be like water.

    <p>The ability to live in your future is what it will be for you. The graet thing about old homes, they
        can also be tranformed into a clean air invironment, however the task will be daunting and at times
        very costly.
