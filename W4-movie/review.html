                    an advanced display of what to expect in the future. The computer imagery and intellectual display 
                    of where we have come from is vast. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a 2009 American science
                    fiction action film directed by Michael Bay and is based on the <em>Transformers</em> toy line. 
                    The film is the sequel to 2007's <em>Transformers</em>, as well as the second installment in the 
                    live-action Transformers film series. Looking forward to  the 'Transformers' spinoff 'Beast Wars' which
