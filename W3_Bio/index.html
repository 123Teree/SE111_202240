            <p> Alvin Terrell about me? We all have alot than we are saying. This path of technology comes from a higher science. Started before we could understand, from the basic 
                sundial to the period of the great depression. The light bulb was a task to the electric car, steam car back then and now.
                The question in technology that is so facinating. Nano technology make me think about both of my grandmothers, why because 
                they both lived through a very exstrodinary time period of survival. "technology"
